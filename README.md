Customer Satisfaction in Online Store

This project is based on a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset made at [Olist Store](https://olist.com/).
Olist is essentially an aggregating platform - it offers suppliers or sellers the possibility to sell their products at their website and connects them to potential buyers.

The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil.
Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, 
product attributes and finally reviews written by customers.
The dataset also released a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates.

Main task is to analyze and report what drives the satisfaction of end-customers in this online store. 
The table `olist_order_reviews_dataset` contains a column `review_score` with values Mfrom 1 to 5 (lowest to highest) reporting the satisfaction from each purchased order. 
This score is essentially the so-called CSAT (customer satisfaction score), popular customer experience metric.
